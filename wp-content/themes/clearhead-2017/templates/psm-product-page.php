						<p><strong>Problem Solution Mapping</strong> is an operating methodology invented at Clearhead based on our observations and cumulative learnings from thousands of UX experiments. We realized we could make a much bigger impact by changing the way we chose ideas, taking time to understand and embrace problems before we proposed or tested solution hypotheses.</p>

							Your map – an evidence-based, fully understood and agreed upon set of goals, problems and hypotheses – becomes the roadmap across your teams. Your Marketers, Product Managers, Merchandisers, Designers, Developers &amp; Analysts all working on solving a common set of Problems; all experimenting towards better outcomes.
						</p>
						<p>
							From this roadmap, Clearhead helps clients start experimenting with <a href="/digital-optimization-programs/">Digital Optimization Programs</a> and/or <a href="/optimization-accelerators/">Optimization Accelerators</a>. From here, all activity is centered around value creation through the continuous solving of critical&nbsp;problems.
